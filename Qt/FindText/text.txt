A C++ program is a sequence of text files (typically header and source files) that contain declarations.

They undergo translation to become an executable program, which is executed when the C++ implementation calls its main function.

Certain words in a C++ program have special meaning, and these are known as keywords. Others can be used as identifiers.

Comments are ignored during translation. C++ programs also contain literals, the values of characters inside them are determined by character sets and encodings.

Certain characters in the program have to be represented with escape sequences.
